### 1) Create a sample project for pyhton application with one test case.
### 2) Make sure use python base image with version.
### 3) Create a Dockerfile to serve the project.
### 4) Create docker-compose to setup the local environment.

## Note:
* Container name must be python-con.
* Image name must be python-img.
* Make sure you choose base linux image like ubuntu,centos,nginx,apache,nodejs etc.
* Please do not use third party images for serve the project.
* You can use multistage dockerfile for serve the project.
* The build layers of the images must be less.
* Make sure to choose compose file version 3.
* The network must be defined under docker-compose. 



## Best Practices for Dockerfile and docker-compose.
* Use volume in docker-compose for runtime changes.
* Include comments on every step in Dockerfile and docker-compose file.
